# Intelligent Learning Connections

## Summary

The Intelligent Learning Connections project aims to develop an AI-powered application focused on enhancing collaborative learning experiences. The core functionality involves a collaborative learning matching system that intelligently pairs learners based on their performance metrics. This facilitates improved engagement and learning outcomes for participants.

## Requirements

### Machine Learning Model/Matching Engine
The project requires the implementation of a robust machine learning model or matching engine. This system will analyze and interpret student performance metrics to facilitate intelligent pairing for collaborative learning.

### User-Friendly Interface
Develop a user-friendly interface accessible to learners. This interface will serve as the platform for learners to engage with the collaborative learning matching system effortlessly.

### Feedback Loop
Establish a feedback mechanism within the application. Learners will provide feedback on their collaborative experiences, contributing to the continuous improvement of the matching model. The feedback loop will be integral in refining the matching engine's effectiveness.

## Data
The necessary data for building the model can be accessed [here](link-to-data). Please refer to the documentation within the repository for details on data usage, formatting, and any preprocessing steps required.
